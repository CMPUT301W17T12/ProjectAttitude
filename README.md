This project was created as a way to track moods. This is an Android application created in Android Studios for use by anyone. By choosing a username for their account, a user is able to keep track of their emotions. This is simply done by creating moods through the interface and updating them as needed. The application also features the ability to follow other users to see what their most recent moods are, as well as a map to even view the locations of where moods were recorded.
